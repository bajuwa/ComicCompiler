# ComicCompiler
Given a set of images, vertically combines them in to 'pages' where the start/end of the page are solid white (or some other specified colour).

## Installation
1. Make sure you can run shell scripts. 
     1. If you're on Windows then you'll need to download the bash or sh executables, or just install something like Git Bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads) that you can use instead of the default command line terminal
2. Install ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
     1. When installing, an option to 'add to path' should already be selected for you. This is required so don't uncheck it!
3. Download the **comcom** file and put it in either:
     1. The directory you want to use it in, or;
     2. In any location on your computer and add that location to your PATH
  
## Command Line Arguments
The arguments for **comcom** are all optional, and if left unspecified they will use the defaults specified below.  

### Minimum Height Per Page
**Shorthand:** -h [number]  
**Longhand:** --min-height-per-page [number]  
**Default:** 5000  
The minimum allowed pixel height per page.  When combining images, the script will not start looking for 'whitespace' until it has first hit this height requirement.

### Input File Name Prefix
**Shorthand:** -i [text]   
**Longhand:** --input-file-prefix [text]  
**Default:** "image"  
Will only combine images that start with this text.  
**Example:** if a directory contains image001.jpg image002.jpg and test.jpg, and you run `comcom -i image`, only image001.jpg and image002.jpg will be combined in to the final page file.

### No Input File Name Prefix
**Shorthand:** -np   
**Longhand:** --no-prefix
**Default:** "" (blank)  
Will only combine any images that match the correct file extension. Overrides -i value.  
**Example:** if a directory contains 001.jpg image002.jpg and test.jpg, and you run `comcom -np`, all three will be combined in to the final page file.


### File Extension
**Shorthand:** -e [text]   
**Longhand:** --extension [text]   
**Default:** ".jpg .jpeg .png" (will check for each file type)  
The file extension of your input images. This value is also included in the initial file selection pattern.  
**Example:** if a directory contains image001.jpg image002.jpg and image003.png, and you run `comcom -e jpg`, only image001.jpg and image002.jpg will be combine in to the final page000.jpg file (the png file will be excluded) otherwise jpg, jpeg and png will all be included. This also sets the output file extension unless set with -oe.

### Additional File Extension
**Shorthand:** -ae [text]   
**Longhand:** --additional-extension [text]   
**Default:** ".jpg .jpeg .png" (will check for each file type)  
The adds another file extension of your input images. This value is also included in the initial file selection pattern.  
**Example:** if a directory contains image001.jpg image002.bmp and image003.tiff, and you run `comcom -ae bmp`, only image001.jpg and image002.bmp will be combine in to the final page000.jpg file (the tiff file will be excluded). This leaves the default output extension as .jpg unless changed with -oe.

### Output File Extension
**Shorthand:** -oe [text]   
**Longhand:** --output-extension [text]   
**Default:** ".jpg" or value of -e if specified  
The file extension of your output images and your output page files.  
**Example:** if a directory contains image001.jpg image002.jpg and image003.png, and you run `comcom -oe png`, the compiled images will be page000.png instead of page000.jpg.  

### Output Page File Prefix
**Shorthand:** -o [text]   
**Longhand:** --output-file-prefix [text]   
**Default:** "page"  
The text that will go at the start of each output page name. The prefix is followed by a 3 digit number (zero-padded page number) and the **File Extension** that was set that matches the input image file types.

### Input Directory
**Shorthand:** -id [text]   
**Longhand:** --input-directory [text]   
**Default:** "./"  
The path to the directory you want to collect image files from. By default it's set to "./" which refers to your **current working directory**, aka the location you're in when you run the script.

### Include subDirectory
**Shorthand:** -is   
**Longhand:** --include-subDirectory   
**Default:** false  
This will include images in subfolders. For example, if folder there is ./chapter1/image1/image01.jpg and ./chapter1/image2/image02.jpg. If the input directory is ./chapter1 then by default, neither image will be found. Enabling this will include both images assuming they match the prefix pattern and file extensions. 

### Output Directory
**Shorthand:** -od [text]   
**Longhand:** --output-directory [text]   
**Default:** "./compiled"  
The path to the directory you want to put the new page files in. By default it's set to "./compiled" which refers to a folder called compiled in your **current working directory**, aka the location you're in when you run the script. It will create the folder if it does not exist

### Output Directory
**Shorthand:** -oh   
**Longhand:** --output-here   
**Default:** "./compiled"  
Sets the directory you want to put the new page files in as the same as "./" or **current working directory**, aka the location you're in when you run the script. By default it's set to "./compiled" which refers to a folder called compiled in your **current working directory**. 

### Whitespace Break Mode
**Shorthand:** -m [number]   
**Longhand:** --whitespace-break-mode [number]   
**Default:** 0  
The "mode" that the script uses to detect where to split up pages. In general, the script will continue to combine images until it  reaches your specified **Minimum Page Height** requirement. After that requirement is hit, it will then start looking for *whitespace* to break on. This mode setting controls how the script tries to find these break points.   
**Mode 0:** This is the simplest mode and runs the fastest. It will try to break pages when it adds an image that *ends in a single line of whitespace*. This means that if your series of images often split panels across images, you will likely generate randomly long page files.  If that's the case, then use mode 1 instead.   
**Mode 1:** This is a more complex algorithm that could take a bit longer as it may need to search the entire image for a breakpoint instead of just the last line of the file.  While this mode takes longer, it often produces more consistent page sizes as it can better handle long unbroken panels or images that don't neatly cut between panels.   

### Break Point Row Check Increments
**Shorthand:** -bi [text]   
**Longhand:** --break-points-increment [number]   
**Default:** 10  
When in **Whitespace Break Mode #1** this value controls how often the script tests a line in an image file for whitespace. Increasing this value will make the script run faster, but may cause smaller whitespace gaps to be missed when trying to split.  Reducing the value will do the opposite: script runs slower but will more reliably detect smaller whitespace gaps between panels.   
**Example:** When running `comcom -m 1 -bi 10` the script will check row 0 for whitespace, then row 10, then row 20, until it either finds whitespace or reaches the end of the file.

### Break Point Row Check Multiplier
**Shorthand:** -bm [text]   
**Longhand:** --break-points-multiplier [number]   
**Default:** 20  
When in **Whitespace Break Mode #1** this value controls how large of a vertical area is pre-tested for *whitespace* before iterating over rows via **Break Point Row Check Increments**.   
**Example:** When running `comcom -m 1 -bi 10 -bm 20` this script will first check a vertical strip down the center of the image that's 200 pixels tall (where bi of 10 times bm of 20 equals 200). If this 200 pixel space doesn't contain any *whitespace* then the script will skip that area and check the next area of 200 pixels. This value can help reduce the number of horizontal rows tested which will reduce script run time.     
**Note:** When increasing/decreasing the **Check Increments** value, consider decreasing/increasing the **Check Multiplier** such that you stay in a range close to 200-300 pixels, otherwise you may lose performance benefits.

### Split Pages on Colour
**Shorthand:** -c [number]   
**Longhand:** --split-on-colour [number]   
**Default:** 65535 (white)  
The decimal notation of the colour you want to split on.  Use 65535 for white (which is the default) or 0 for black. For this set of documentation any reference to *whitespace* will actually refer to the colour specified here, not necessarily 'white'.

### Colour Split Error Tolerance
**Shorthand:** -ce [number]   
**Longhand:** --colour-error-tolerance [number]   
**Default:** 0  
If the images aren't always the exact same colour but are often within a range of colours, change this value to allow for more variance in what decimal colour values are 'accepted' to split by.  Regardless of this error tolerance, the entire horizontal line must still be a solid colour. 

### Logging Mode
**Shorthand:** -l [number]   
**Longhand:** --logging-mode [number], --debug, --verbose   
**Default:** 0  
Controls how much text is output to the console while the script is running. Mode 0 only reports the bare minimum of which image range was compiled into which page file.  Mode 1 (aka debug) reports additional info that describes which broad 'decisions' were made during the scripts execution. Mode 2 (aka verbose) will report everything in debug mode as well as specific data values that lead to the script decisions.   
**Example:** `comcom -l 1` is equivalent to `comcom --debug` and `comcom -l 2` is equivalent to `comcom --verbose`

### ImageMagick Version
**Shorthand:** -im6, -im7
**Default:** Version 7  
This flag will allow you to specify a specific version of ImageMagick to use when running **comcom**. By default it uses Version 7 (`-im7`) as that's the most recent version available at the time I write this.  Version 6 is also supported via the `-im6` flag.
